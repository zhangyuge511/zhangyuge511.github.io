# rhythm_game
A rhythm game using the Web Audio API and Canvas, no frameworks.

Built for a course in JavaScript at Nackademin in September 2015, but with some recent touchups. With gameplay inspired by Dance Dance Revolution, this game is automatically generated from an mp3-file and will never be exactly the same.
